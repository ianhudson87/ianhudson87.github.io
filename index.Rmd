####### I KNOW HOW TO MAKE A WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

# Class Reflection
Here are some of the things that have been the *most useful aspects* of this class:

1. Programming in R
    - It was hard to learn but will be useful later on
2. Webscraping
    - Seems like there are a lot of things I can do with this
3. Learning about what Political Science really is

There are just some of the many things I have learned
